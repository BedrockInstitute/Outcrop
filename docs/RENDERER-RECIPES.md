# Renderer style recipes

This is Outcrop's maintained recipe index for textbook authors and the renderer.
Historical first-use examples link to Bedrock source; they are examples, not
required project files or implicit policies. The initial inventory follows `Base.Prelude`, `Base.Impredicativity`, then `Base.Classical` in reading
order. "First use" means the first occurrence in those three chapters, not the date a
style was introduced. Refer to a recipe by its stable ID when requesting a new passage
or figure. Reuse the existing classes; do not copy their CSS into chapter markup.

## Page navigation

`navigation.section-tree` renders the chapter's h2–h6 hierarchy as nested lists.
Every heading with children uses `details.toc-branch`, closed by default; its
summary contains the heading link. The disclosure arrow and keyboard activation
toggle the child list, while the link navigates to the heading. First use:
[Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), the subsections under Logical operations.

On a change of the current reading section, `static/reader/navigation.js` opens exactly the
branches containing its link and closes the others, including when entering by
a fragment URL or scrolling backward. Manual toggles remain in effect until the
current heading changes. The existing scroll tracker supplies the active heading,
so the breadcrumb, highlighted link and expanded branches share one position.
The outer Contents section and other sidebar groups keep their own disclosure
state. `PageRenderer.toc_html` in `outcrop.site.page_renderer` and the shared CSS own the structure and
spacing; chapters need no navigation markup. Chapter links above and below the
article use the localized Previous chapter / Next chapter labels without a route
prefix.

The sticky reading-position bar in `static/reader/navigation.js` also opens a chapter directory.
It starts with the first section heading, without repeating the chapter title,
and initially folds subordinate headings under their
parent sections, except along the current heading's path. Readers may toggle
each branch independently. The panel sizes to its visible contents, scrolls
internally only when necessary, and closes on an outside click or document scroll.
For a heading with children, only its title text navigates; the remaining row
toggles its branch. A heading without children remains a full-row link.
The sidebar starts with Interactive contents folded and Current route open.
Namespace browsing belongs to the dependency graph; there is no separate module tree.
Current route lists its catalog chapters and highlights the present chapter. The
guide's route selection is remembered, with a containing route used when the
reader opens a chapter outside that selection.

## Prose and code

| Recipe ID | Use and canonical source form | First use | Implementation / checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prose.parallel` | Three language blocks, followed by shared Agda fences; matching chapter/subsection structure | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), opening and "Reading guide" | `outcrop.core.i18n_markers`, chapter-framework and literary-exposition gates |
| `prose.term` | First introduction `[term]{.term-intro #id}`; explicit later reference `[term]{.term-ref #id}` | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `object-theory` in the opening | `glossary.toml`, glossary renderer and gate; never duplicate term metadata locally |
| `code.reference` | Inline `` `name`{.Agda} `` links to a checked Agda name | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `Type ℓ` under "Universe levels" | `outcrop.core.agda_semantics` resolves references; formal code remains in Agda fences |
| `code.reference-alias` | `[label](Module.html#declaration){.Agda}` displays a short label while linking and hovering over the named declaration | [Origin](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Origin.lagda.md), `V` linked to `𝒮ᵥ` | `outcrop.core.agda_semantics` resolves the symbolic target to its Agda position and rejects unknown declarations |
| `code.display` | One centered `<div>` containing one `<code>` for reader-facing notation; see the template below | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `Type ℓ : Type (ℓ-suc ℓ)` | `static/outcrop.css`, `static/reader/navigation.js`, one-line rule in `outcrop.core.prose_lint` |
| `code.display-note` | `code.display` with localized `data-note="..."` explaining the notation | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), the same universe-level expression | Desktop margin note; narrow-screen tap/focus note; keep the annotation in its language block |
| `prose.margin-note` | `span.prose-annotation-target` followed by `aside.prose-annotation-note` | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), why types cannot generally be moved downward after `Lift` | `static/outcrop.css` and `static/reader/navigation.js`; use for a brief attached qualification |
| `code.boilerplate` | `.boilerplate-hover` linked to a generated template; `.boilerplate-hover-popup` shell | Chapter title and learning-route direct prerequisites | Dashed underline plus code mark; actual compiler-highlighted setup; code-block background/border, subtle blue left edge and floating shadow distinguish revealed source from type hints; shared recursive code hover and mobile modal action |
| `code.syntax-help` | `.syntax-hover` on compiler-classified keywords | OPTIONS, module declarations, imports and body code | Amber active background distinct from definition highlighting; trilingual explanation and versioned official documentation link |
| `code.submodule-fold` | Default-open `details.submodule-fold` whose complete Agda module declaration occupies the clickable `summary`; see template below | [Impredicativity](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Impredicativity.lagda.md), `CodedTruth` | Animated folding, rendered code without module-scope indentation, and at most one nested child fold; whole-tree coverage, declaration, scope and depth checked by `outcrop.core.prose_lint` |
| `prose.statement` | `**Definition** (`name`{.Agda}) Text`; also Construction, Fact, Lemma, Theorem, Corollary with localized labels | [Impredicativity](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Impredicativity.lagda.md), `hasSize` | `.prose-statement`; every statement encloses Agda code and its own immediate `∎`, including in folds; checked in all three languages |
| `prose.proof` | `**Proof** Text`, alternating explanation and code, with standalone `∎` directly after the final code block | [Impredicativity](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Impredicativity.lagda.md), `ΩResizing→Resizing` | `.prose-proof`; continues one statement or starts a standalone proof; must enclose code after its label |
| `prose.statement-ending` | Final Agda fence followed by standalone `∎` | [Choice](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Choice.lagda.md), `SetChoice` and nested helpers | `.statement-ending` and `.statement-qed`; exact semi-transparent ∎ inside the lower-right code frame, full containing-column width, no outdent or external gutter, shared by pages and modal mirrors |

Related parallel declarations use one Construction header containing individually
styled Agda names separated by spaces, followed by a bullet per name. Never stack
statement labels above one shared code block and QED. The mark reserves no extra
line or bottom padding and keeps a fixed opacity of 0.25, including over code.
The [Markdown contract](RENDERER-MARKDOWN.md) defines the unchanged source syntax
and lint obligations. Agda token streams and anchor identities remain unchanged.

### Prose comparison tables

`prose.comparison-table` uses an ordinary Markdown table when the reader needs to
compare parallel statements, corresponding data, or cases. Existing `main table`,
`th` and `td` rules provide the border, spacing and header surface. Keep cells short;
long arguments belong in the surrounding prose. The initial three chapters did
not use prose tables. The first catalogued use is [Choice](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Choice.lagda.md), for existence statements, lifted data
and the two decision cases. Tables do not replace mathematical type-space diagrams.

### Centered code display

```html
<div class="single-line-code"><code>`expression`{.Agda}</code></div>
```

### Default-open submodule fold

````html
<details open class="submodule-fold">
<summary class="submodule-fold-heading">
```agda
module Example where
```
</summary>
<div class="submodule-fold-content">

<!--en-->
Explain the first construction in Example.
<!--zh-->
解释 Example 中的第一个构造。
<!--ja-->
Example の最初の構成を説明する。
<!--/-->

```agda
  example = value
```

</div>
</details>
````

The declaration occupies the summary's only code block and remains visible when
collapsed. The content starts directly below it and ends after the last code fence
in that submodule and its QED; a closing proof mark stays inside the fold. The block has a theme-aware
background and an indented frame, with less padding on mobile. Body-code edges align
within each submodule's own column, not across nesting levels. The declaration keeps
its original compact summary style. Body code fills its own column; neither
ordinary nor statement-ending code reserves an external QED gutter or outdent.
The website animates both
directions and retains native keyboard semantics.

## Figures

All figure recipes compose `book-diagram`, a stable `fig-*` ID, `aria-describedby`,
and a direct trilingual `figcaption`. Place the explanation and hypotheses before
the figure and use the caption for its takeaway. Figures have no outer decorative
frame by default and no internal scrolling. Never follow a figure immediately with
an Agda code block: put the code after its explanation, or reorganize the surrounding
prose. The diagram gate checks each language, including folded submodules and
invisible intervening wrappers/comments. Use `figure.frame` when the components
need an explicit overall boundary; the caption always stays outside that boundary.
The first common shell is `fig-pi-sigma` in Prelude.

| Recipe ID | Reusable structure | First use | Reuse guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `figure.frame` | One direct `div.diagram-framed` for the diagram content, followed by a sibling `figcaption` outside the frame | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-fiber-general` | Groups formulas, spaces and labels; never frame the overall description; the diagram gate enforces this structure |
| `figure.compare` | `type-comparison-panels` with `diagram-panel` | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-pi-sigma` | Parallel alternatives; align corresponding rows and center their contents |
| `figure.space` | HTML `diagram-space` or SVG `diagram-space-shape` | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-type-transport` | A box denotes a mathematical type space; place elements inside and the type label above them |
| `figure.paths` | `path-stage`, SVG `viewBox`, positioned `path-label` | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-path-operations` | Ordinary paths: blue, no arrowheads, white endpoints with blue outlines; `refl` is a point |
| `figure.path-map` | `diagram-panel.path-single` with one path stage | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-path-cong` | One function's action on paths; use `diagram-map-line` / `diagram-map-tip` for function arrows |
| `figure.transport` | `transport-scene`: two type spaces above two base elements, joined by a path below | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-type-transport`; reused by `fig-path-transport` | Keep transport and subst visually parallel; dashed guides express correspondence, not functions |
| `figure.factorization` | Three SVG type-space boxes, functions between them, and related terms inside the target box | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-subst-factorization` | Reuse the composition, role classes and alignment; choose geometry for the actual formulas |
| `figure.pointwise` | `funext-scene`: sampled paths and a result space | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-path-funext` | A family of pointwise paths gives a path of functions |
| `figure.implications` | `hlevel-panels`, internal assumptions, examples and definitions, with `hlevel-link` connectors | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-hlevel-distinction` | Align corresponding panel regions; logical implications use implication symbols |
| `figure.universe-copy` | `level-scene`, two type spaces and a separate properties row | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-universe-homotopy` | Distinguish movement of universe level from preservation of properties |
| `figure.factorization-math` | A single framed `factorization-stage` containing three type labels and three SVG function arrows | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-truncation-rec`; reused by [Choice](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Choice.lagda.md), `fig-choice-truncation` | Draw the diagonal arrow across the full distance between source and target; show only the three distinct types and maps, without duplicating the codomain to make a square |
| `figure.resizing` | `resizing-comparison` / `resizing-case`: title, note, assumption, centered scene, conclusion | [Impredicativity](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Impredicativity.lagda.md), `fig-resizing-comparison` | Scene rows share a vertical center; conclusion formulas align; narrow layouts stack panels |
| `figure.path-space` | `coded-truth-proof-scene`: two proof spaces and the ambient type, with `diagram-path-space` lens | [Impredicativity](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Impredicativity.lagda.md), `fig-coded-truth` | Align proof points; put endpoint labels next to endpoints; the shaded family is schematic, not a literal subspace of Ω |
| `figure.roundtrips` | `type-comparison-panels classical-roundtrips`, parallel path stages | [Classical](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Classical.lagda.md), `fig-classical-roundtrips` | Two round-trip laws displayed in matching geometry, with paths for equality |
| `figure.compact-map` | `diagram-compact-stage` inside the standard frame or comparison columns | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-truncation-witnesses` | Vertically aligned source/target spaces, bounded width, shared label size; reused in `fig-lower-lem` |
| `figure.fibres` | `fiber-general` with one `fiber-fan-stage` containing independent `fiber-bundle` groups | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-fiber-general` | Function arrows send sampled points of A into B; each tuft of blue hairs joins their images to its own fixed base point inside B. A fibre point comprises a domain point and a path; never portray these hairs as contraction paths inside the fibre |
| `figure.indexed-slots` | `diagram-indexed`, a three-column `vector-slots` strip, and aligned index/result points | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-fin-vector-lookup` | The strip represents entries of one vector, not a type space; arrows denote `lookup` with that vector fixed; numerical index labels must be explained in prose |
| `interaction.fibre-contraction` | `fiber-fan-stage`, `fiber-bundle`, `fiber-hair`, moving domain/image points and maps; fixed `fiber-base-point`, per-group `data-center-path`, sample/centre labels | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), `fig-fiber-general` | Click/Enter/Space contracts each fibre independently. All hairs in a group merge into the nonconstant path p_i stored in data-center-path; their image endpoints merge at f(a_i), separately from the fixed b_i. Domain points and function arrows merge in step. Initially show only candidate arrows and labels a_ij, with no extra centre arrow. Show a_i only when contraction finishes; restore a_ij on expansion. Targets are derived from each group’s stored path geometry. Activate again to expand. Requires a contraction witness, not just chosen centres; final coincidence depicts path equality. |
| `interaction.path-space` | `coded-truth-trigger`, moving region/path copies and target point classes | [Impredicativity](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Impredicativity.lagda.md), `fig-coded-truth` | Click/Enter/Space unfolds a path family while whole paths shrink to points; gentle fill pulse, no play button; activation always plays the animation |

Appearance is centralized in `src/outcrop/site/resources/static/outcrop.css`;
animation is owned by the appropriate `static/reader/` feature modules. Shared SVG roles and allowed geometry are enforced by
`outcrop.core.diagram_style`, called by the renderer and `check-diagrams.py`.
Logical implication connectors use `diagram-implication` and the neutral
`--diagram-relation-color` token. The older `hlevel-link` class is a layout
alias for the same role, not a hyperlink. Never use `--link-color` for diagram
relations, paths, arrows or decorative geometry: it denotes actual navigation.
The diagram gate checks shared CSS, including classes found in chapter figures,
and rejects that misuse. Actual `a` elements and Agda/terminology links inside
figures retain their own link colours; do not recolour all figure descendants.
Diagram spacing follows one responsive scale: the figure shell owns its outer rhythm,
`diagram-framed` owns the inset inside an overall frame, `diagram-panel` owns each
parallel panel's inset, `diagram-space` owns the closest inset around mathematical
objects, and `--diagram-gap` separates siblings. Keep these four levels distinct.
Do not repair spacing with per-figure margins or padding. On narrow screens the shared
tokens contract together, comparison grids stack, and wide three-part constructions
reduce their connector column while preserving readable mathematical content and no
horizontal scrolling.
For a comparison grouped by a single outer frame, see Prelude's
`fig-proposition-and-proof`: it composes `figure.compare`, `figure.space` and
`figure.paths`, enclosed by `figure.frame`. Each column places the packaged proposition above its underlying
type space and the certificate's type below it. Empty and inhabited examples share
the same geometry, so absence of proof remains visible. The caption distinguishes
the certificate function from its path-valued application; do not explain this
distinction by whether a label is inside or outside a box.
Animation initialization is per figure: `figure:has(.fiber-fan-stage)` enables
fibre contraction and `figure:has(.coded-truth-trigger)` enables path-space motion.
Each instance owns its geometry and state. Reuse the recipe classes with a new
stable figure ID; never copy another figure's ID. No particular chapter or figure
identifier is required by the shared initializer.

## Navigation and animation

Mathematical animations remain available on activation. Do not disable them as
a generic styling shortcut or replace their geometric meaning with a static cue.
Interface transitions may honor reduced-motion settings independently; print
output remains static. Keep motion purposeful: use gentle
attention cues and short interface transitions; mathematical animations run on activation.
Pulse only the mathematical objects that animate, never an entire containing space
or background. The shared cues cycle gently every 2.4 seconds while idle, pause
during playback and return when another activation is available. Fibre hairs and
point outlines use `diagram-interaction-stroke-pulse` (varying shades of blue,
white point interiors); the path-space lens uses `diagram-interaction-color-pulse`
on its fill. A line-width change alone is not an animation affordance. Contracted
fibres retain the pulse on the merged paths and point outlines to signal expansion.

| Recipe ID | Reusable structure | First use | Reuse guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `navigation.page-scroll` | Shared `.page-scroll` with two icon buttons | Every page using `src/outcrop/site/resources/template.html` | Fixed bottom right; click scrolls smoothly to the document top or bottom; localized accessible labels; reserve footer space on narrow screens |
| `navigation.chapter` | `.chapnav-top` below the chapter heading and `.chapnav` at the end | [Prelude](https://github.com/BedrockInstitute/Bedrock/blob/main/src/Base/Prelude.lagda.md), then every chapter in reading order | Generate both from the same previous/next links; omit unavailable neighbors; wrap long titles on narrow screens |

Page controls and their motion live in packaged `static/reader/` modules and
`static/outcrop.css`; chapter links are generated by `outcrop.site.page_renderer`.
Relative `static/` paths in this recipe refer to `src/outcrop/site/resources/`.

## Maintenance

1. Before adding a style, choose an existing recipe ID and cite its first-use figure or
   passage. Geometry and mathematical labels remain specific to each construction.
2. Add a recipe here only when the existing set cannot express the intended reading
   structure. Record its stable ID, source form, exact first-use locator, implementation
   and checks. Update this table whenever an example moves or a class is renamed.
3. Keep colors, borders, padding, gaps and responsive behavior in shared CSS. Inline
   figure styles may specify only `left`, `top` and `aspect-ratio`. Do not nest decorative
   panels or use arrowheads for mere association. Higher paths may use filled regions.
4. Check trilingual weaving, relevant prose gates and diagram lint; preview desktop and
   narrow screens. A change to nesting or parsing also needs focused gate tests.
   Keep formal Agda tokens unchanged for a styling-only change.
5. This index records supported recipes, not every incidental selector. The normative
   constraints remain the [Markdown contract](RENDERER-MARKDOWN.md) and shared lint
   implementations. A consuming project may add its own mathematical policies.
